# WebScrapping

Multiple url given as a input in HTML page then the url is passed on to the API (java servlets) where the tomcat server loads the url in puppeteer (one by one) or puppeteer cluster (parallel) where we can scrap the entire HTML content and save the result in file. Using the jsoup from API we can parse the html content and displayed the required thing (words and outgoing links) in JSON fromat in the browser deployed in tomcat server.
